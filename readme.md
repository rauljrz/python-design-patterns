# Python: Design Patterns

If you’re a programmer, you’re probably plenty busy, so why not save some time and avoid reinventing the wheel by reusing well-proven design solutions—software design patterns—to improve your code quality? Design patterns encourage programming efficiency and code reuse.

This 15 essential creational, structural, and behavioral patterns to help you solve common coding challenges, while introducing best practices that can help keep your solutions consistent, complete, and correct.

a) Creational Patterns
1 - Factory: Encapsulates object creation. That is, factory is an object specializing in creating other objects.
2 - Abstract Factory: Is useful when its user expects to receive a family of related object at a given time but doesn't have to know which family it is until runtime.
3 - Singleton: Is the pattern you need When you want to allow only one object to be created from a class. It's an object-oriented way of providing global variables.
4 - Builder: Is a solution to an anti-pattern called telescoping constructor. Occurs when a software developer attempts to build a complex object using an excessive number of constructors.
