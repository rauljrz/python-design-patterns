# Python: Design Patterns

If you’re a programmer, you’re probably plenty busy, so why not save some time and avoid reinventing the wheel by reusing well-proven design solutions—software design patterns—to improve your code quality? Design patterns encourage programming efficiency and code reuse.

This 15 essential creational, structural, and behavioral patterns to help you solve common coding challenges, while introducing best practices that can help keep your solutions consistent, complete, and correct.

1 - Factory: Encapsulates object creation. That is, factory is an object specializing in creating other objects.
2 - Abstract Factory: Is useful when its user expects to receive a family of related object at a given time but doesn't have to know which family it is until runtime.
